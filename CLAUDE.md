# CLAUDE.md

Compatibility note: this repository is now documented for Codex-first workflows.

## Primary Agent Instructions

Use `AGENTS.md` as the canonical source of agent guidance:

- Project context and directory conventions
- VM build/test workflow on macOS
- Deployment workflow (deploy-rs)
- Documentation and ticket update requirements

## Why this file still exists

Some tooling expects `CLAUDE.md`. Keep this file as a stable pointer so both Claude Code and Codex users read the same repository rules from `AGENTS.md`.
